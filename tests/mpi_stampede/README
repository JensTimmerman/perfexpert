This test checks a MPI simple ping code. The objective is to verify the '-p'
argument and be sure the compilaion using mpicc works fine. The mpi_ping
program also receive two command line arguments. Recommender shouls provide
(useless) recommendations to change the MPI library becasue most of the time is
spent into MPI calls. Of course, it will be impossible to apply any of these
recommendations.

This test works for Stamepede. Probably, for other systems you shoud change the
run command to set the proper MPIRUN prefix.
