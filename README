COMPILING AND INSTALLING:
-------------------------
To compile OptTran just run: 

    $ mkdir _build
    $ cd _build
    $ ../configure [options]
	$ make
    $ make install

If the 'configure' script is not available on your source tree, probably you
have retrieved this code from our source code repository. It means you will
need some GNU tools to generate the 'configure'. The recommended version of the
tools you will need:

    - M4,       1.4.13 or newer (ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/m4/)
    - Autoconf  2.63 or newer   (ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/autoconf/)
    - Automake  1.11.1 or newer (ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/automake/)
    - Libtool   2.2.6b or newer (ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/libtool/)

If you have all these GNU tools, to generate the 'configure' script just run:

    $ ./autogen.sh
