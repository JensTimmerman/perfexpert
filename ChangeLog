2013 02 02 - First version added to the git control version system

Known Bugs:
 - if the recommendation database exists, the installation script generates an
   error while trying to build the database
 - the lcpi.properties may be slight different from one machine to other,
   therefore, PerfExpert may output some warnings when using the
   perfexper-experiment.xml example file from contrib (or $prefix/share/opttran)
   directory
