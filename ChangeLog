2013 05 21 - Renaming PerfExpert to Analyzer and OptTran to PerfExpert
2013 05 20 - The workflow script now iterates more than one optimization cycle
2013 05 06 - Adding Minst (MACPO) to the tool chain
2013 02 02 - First version added to the git control version system

Known issues:

 - if the recommendation database exists, the installation script generates an
   warning message to replace the current installed database
   
 - the lcpi.properties may be slight different from one machine to other,
   therefore, PerfExpert may output some warnings when using the
   perfexpert-experiment.xml example file from contrib
   directory
