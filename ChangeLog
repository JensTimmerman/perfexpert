2013 05 06 - Adding Minst (MACPO) to the tool chain

2013 02 02 - First version added to the git control version system

Known issues:

 - if the recommendation database exists, the installation script generates an
   warning message to replace the current installed database
   
 - the lcpi.properties may be slight different from one machine to other,
   therefore, PerfExpert may output some warnings when using the
   perfexper-experiment.xml example file from contrib (or $prefix/share/opttran)
   directory
